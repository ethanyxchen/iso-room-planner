# Iso Room Planner

An isometric room planner that turns floor plan images into interactive 3D views. Upload a floor plan, and the app parses it with AI, renders it as an isometric scene, and lets you furnish rooms by dragging furniture from a catalog.

## Features

- **AI floor plan parsing** — upload a floor plan image and get a structured grid with detected rooms
- **Isometric 3D view** — live canvas rendering with color-coded rooms, walls, and labels
- **Furniture catalog** — place sofas, beds, tables, chairs, and more with collision detection
- **Drag-and-drop** — move furniture around in the isometric view
- **Auto-furnish** — AI-powered or algorithmic furniture placement by room type
- **Preset floor plans** — sample layouts to get started quickly

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A [Google Gemini API key](https://ai.google.dev/) (used for floor plan parsing and auto-furnish)

### Environment Setup

Copy the example env file and add your API key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then fill in your key in `.env.local`:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

> **Note:** Never commit `.env.local`. It is gitignored by default.

### Install and Run

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

The app runs at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Other Commands

```bash
yarn build         # production build
yarn lint          # run oxlint
yarn lint:fix      # run oxlint with auto-fix
```
